## Outline

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "20c291a668"
```

`@part1`
- Introduce logistic regression
- Mention that it's often used for predicting PD
- Introduce why PD is used and what it impacts
- Short demo of logistic regression in python (code snippet)

## Logistic Regression in Python

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "dd992832d2"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Classification algorithm used to predict probability of a class
- Produces decimal values associated with the probability of a predicted class

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
clf = LogisiticRegression()
```

## Logistic Regression for Credit Risk

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5fac3bfd84"
```

`@part1`
- Most common algorithm used for predicting probability of default (PD)
- Produces decimal values associated with the probability of a predicted class
- Graph with classes (showing different colors as an example)
- Next slide has annotated graph showing the different classes

## Probability of Default

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9682da0499"
```

`@part1`
- What is PD
- Why PD is used
- It's impact (number of loans, loss at default, etc)
- Curve showing risk and population (strategy)


`@script`

## Risk Scorecards

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e469892004"
```

`@part1`
- PD part in scorecarding
- Talk about the risk over time (point of time considered for this class)
- Example picture of a scorecard (simple Pandas example?)
