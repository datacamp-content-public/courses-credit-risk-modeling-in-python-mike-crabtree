`@script`
In the previous exercises, we used a logistic regression to compute probability of default and analyzed the performance.
We set some of the hyperparameters to specific values, but what if we want to try a range of different values?
That's where gridsearch comes into play!

`@script`
Here is an example of a logistic regression in Python using ScikitLearn complete with some set hyperparameters.
While not all hyperparameters are good candidates for grid search, we can use a set of simple ones to help us optimize the performance of our model.
