## 2.4 Easy Hyperparameters with GridSearch

```yaml

`@script`
In the previous exercises, we used a logistic regression to compute probability of default and analyzed the performance.
We set some of the hyperparameters to specific values, but what if we want to try a range of different values?
That's where gridsearch comes into play!

`@script`
Here is an example of a logistic regression in Python using ScikitLearn complete with some set hyperparameters.
While not all hyperparameters are good candidates for grid search, we can use a set of simple ones to help us optimize the performance of our model.

| Parameter     | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| C             | Inverse regularization parameter|


`@script`
The first of those hyperparameters is going to be C.  C is the parameter which is used for inverse regularization.
This is a value that is used to help us prevent our model from overfitting to the training set as is the case with most machine learning models.  Remember, the smaller the C value, the stronger the regularization.
