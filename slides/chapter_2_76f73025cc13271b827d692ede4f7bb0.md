## 2.4 Easy Hyperparameters with GridSearch

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "e2582b6328"
```

`@lower_third`

name: Michael Crabtree
title: Data Scientist, Ford Motor Company


`@script`
In the previous exercises, we used a logistic regression to compute probability of default and analyzed the performance.
We set some of the hyperparameters to specific values, but what if we want to try a range of different values?
That's where gridsearch comes into play!

## Logistic Regression Hyperparameters

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "49db2f3f0a"

`@script`
Here is an example of a logistic regression in Python using ScikitLearn complete with some set hyperparameters.
While not all hyperparameters are good candidates for grid search, we can use a set of simple ones to help us optimize the performance of our model.

| Parameter     | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| C             | Inverse regularization parameter|


`@script`
The first of those hyperparameters is going to be C.  C is the parameter which is used for inverse regularization.
This is a value that is used to help us prevent our model from overfitting to the training set as is the case with most machine learning models.  Remember, the smaller the C value, the stronger the regularization.

| Parameter     | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| C             | Inverse regularization parameter|
| max_iter    | Max iterations for solvers to converge      |


`@script`
Next is the max iter parameter, which is used to control the maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.  The solver in this case is the lbfgs you see in the code.

| Parameter     | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| C             | Inverse regularization parameter|
| max_iter    | Max iterations for solvers to converge      |
| rand_state | Seed for random shuffling      |


`@script`
Last, but not least, is the random state parameter.  This is an integer used as a seed for the pseudo random shuffling of the data prior to fitting.  While this is not generally used for the lbfgs solver, it gives us an opportunity to play with searching through more values using gridsearch.

## What is GridSearchCV?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b2d55ac937"
```

`@part1`
- Exhaustive search over a dictionary of parameters
- Implements `fit` and `score` from Scikit Learn
- Imported from `model_selection`
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
```


`@script`
So I've mentioned grid search several times now, but what exactly is it?
Grid search is a method within Scikit learn which allows us to pass in a machine learning model as well as a dictionary of hyperparameters to figure out which combination of those hyperparameters works best.
Grid search is able to find the best combination because it will implement both a fit and score method.
The grid search method is imported from model selection from scikit learn.
