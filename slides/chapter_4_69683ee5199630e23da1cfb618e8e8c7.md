In this lesson, we are going to talk more about putting our best predictive model to good use.  But first, let's review the results.

## Model Results

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d7a482bc50"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

`@part2`
- Probability of default for each loan in test set
- Sorted in ascending order for convenience


`@script`
Here is a simple example of some of our best model's predictions for probability of default.  Notice that I have the values sorted in ascending order to help conceptualize what is acceptable and what is not based on these probabilities.

## Model Results

`@part2`
- Probability of default for each loan in test set
- Sorted in ascending order for convenience
- Not all are acceptable for our strategy{{2}}


`@script`
Have a look at loan 4, which has been estimated to have an estimated probability of default at 85%.  Now that we are at this point, we must consider what predicted values are acceptable for our firm, and what values are not acceptable.  More often than not, 85% probability of default is considered too risky to accept.
With this in mind, we need some way to ensure that these loans are marked as being too risky.


---
## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f90699ae32"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

`@script`
This is where the cutoff value becomes important.  The cutoff value is a value we set based on how we want new loans to be judged without manual intervention like in our last example.
We know that no model is perfect, and that we will have to accept some number of loans which will default despite how hard we try to avoid them.  The idea here is to minimize the number of defaults we can tolerate in our portfolio.  We want to minimize the number of defaults we have, but how?
First, let's use the quantile function from numpy to get our cutoff value.


---
## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a71bd950c8"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

```python
np.quantile(credit_loan_data['prob_default'], 0.85)
```

```python
0.75
```


`@script`
Look at the example code for using quantile.  We want to know the cutoff value for loan default status in 15% of our test set, so we need to find the 85% quantile of our probabilities of default in our data.
So we can use this as an 85% acceptance rate to change the test set's default status as it aligns with our overall strategy.


---
## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2d4d70dde5"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new loans accepted based on the cutoff value

```python
if prob_default > cutoff_value:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}


`@script`
The acceptance rate is based on the cutoff value we just found using the quantile for our data.  
This allows us to implement our strategy and impose it on the test set such that we chance the default status from 0 to 1 or vice versa.


---
## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "31bc94031f"
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new loans accepted
- Based on the cutoff value

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4760/datasets/0d3a7facf7c00072bd3b26cbf4fee0c8029efeba/bad_rate_ex.PNG)


`@script`
After the changes have been made, we can compare our new loan status values against the true loan status values from the test set.
For the most part, it looks like we did pretty well, but not all of the loan status values stayed the same.


---
## Bad Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ae3e1fe56"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of the new loans allowed by acceptance rate that are actually defaults

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4760/datasets/08494b8f41e9384eb3f420e5129e6254d4cbed6a/bad_rate_ex_circle.PNG)


`@script`
Notice the second to last loan in this example.  It appears as though our strategy had us accept a loan which actually ended up defaulting.
As mentioned before, we know that no model is perfect and that there are going to be some defaults in our loan mix.  The number of defaults accepted by our strategy is known as the bad rate.


---
## Acceptance Rate Strategy

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "532a5ff166"
```

`@part1`
- Used to test different combinations of acceptance rate and bad rate based on the firm's tolerances
- If we can only accept 8% of our new loans to be bad, then we would set acceptance rate to 80%


`@part2`
