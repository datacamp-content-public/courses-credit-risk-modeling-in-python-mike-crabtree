In this lesson, we are going to talk more about putting our best predictive model to good use.  But first, let's review the results.

## Model Results

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d7a482bc50"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`

`@part2`
- Probability of default for each loan in test set
- Sorted in ascending order for convenience


`@script`
Here is a simple example of some of our best model's predictions for probability of default.  Notice that I have the values sorted in ascending order to help conceptualize what is acceptable and what is not based on these probabilities.

`@part2`
- Probability of default for each loan in test set
- Sorted in ascending order for convenience
- Not all are acceptable for our strategy{{2}}


`@script`
Have a look at loan 4, which has been estimated to have an estimated probability of default at 85%.  Now that we are at this point, we must consider what predicted values are acceptable for our firm, and what values are not acceptable.  More often than not, 85% probability of default is considered too risky to accept.
With this in mind, we need some way to ensure that these loans are marked as being too risky.

## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f90699ae32"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a71bd950c8"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

```python
np.quantile(credit_loan_data['prob_default'], 0.85)
```


`@script`



---
## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2d4d70dde5"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new loans accepted
- Based on the cutoff value

```python
if prob_default > cutoff_value:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}


`@script`



---
## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "31bc94031f"
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new loans accepted
- Based on the cutoff value

`@script`



---
## Bad Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ae3e1fe56"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of the new loans allowed by acceptance rate that are actually defaults

## Acceptance Rate Strategy

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "532a5ff166"
```

`@part1`
- Used to test different combinations of acceptance rate and bad rate based on the firm's tolerances
- If we can only accept 8% of our new loans to be bad, then we would set acceptance rate to 80%


`@part2`

## Visualizing the Strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ecf0351f27"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Plots acceptance and bad rates to better visualize the concept of our acceptance rate strategy
