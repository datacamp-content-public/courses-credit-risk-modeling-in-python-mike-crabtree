## Cutoff Value

```yaml

key: "f90699ae32"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a71bd950c8"
code_zoom: 85
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit on how many defaults are acceptable in the portfolio
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

```python
np.quantile(credit_loan_data['prob_default'], 0.85)
```

## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2d4d70dde5"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new loans accepted
- Based on the cutoff value

```python
if prob_default > cutoff_value:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}

## Bad Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ae3e1fe56"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of the new loans allowed by acceptance rate that are actually defaults

## Acceptance Rate Strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7cb8753e74"
```

`@part1`
- Used to test different combinations of acceptance rate and bad rate based on the firm's tolerances
- If I can only accept 8% of my loans to be bad, then my acceptance rate might be 65%
