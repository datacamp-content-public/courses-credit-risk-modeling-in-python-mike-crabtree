## Outline

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4f999f1542"
```

`@part1`
- Acceptance Rage
- Bad Rate
- Cutoff
- Calculating cutoff


`@script`



---
## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f90699ae32"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit for how many probable defaults are accepted
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

```python
np.quantile(credit_loan_data['prob_default'], 0.85)
```

- Graph of two distributions for non-default and default with a cutoff line going into the second graph (default)


`@script`



---
## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2d4d70dde5"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new incoming loans accepted
- Essentially the true-positive (TP) fraction of loans from our confusion matrix (sensitivity)

```python
if prob_default > cutoff:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}


`@script`



---
## Bad Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ae3e1fe56"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of the new loans allowed by acceptance rate that are actually defaults
- Essentially the false-positive (FP) fraction of loans from our confusion matrix (1 - specificity)

```python
sum(new_default_after_cutoff)/length(new_default_after_cutoff)
```{{2}}

- Pandas screenshot with some loan status changes highlighted

## Strategy Testing

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7cb8753e74"
```

`@part1`
- Used to test different combinations of acceptance rate and bad rate based on the firm's tolerances
- Example table


`@script`

## Visualizing the Strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ecf0351f27"
```

`@part1`
- Plots Acceptance Rate against Bad Rate to better establish 
- Example plot

`@part1`
- Code snippet on calculating these for the given data?
