## Acceptance Rate, Bad Rate, and Cutoff

## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f90699ae32"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit for how many probable defaults are accepted
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

## Cutoff Value

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a71bd950c8"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Used to set a limit for how many probable defaults are accepted
- Establish a cutoff value by using `quantile()` on the data

```python
np.quantile(credit_loan_data['prob_default'], 0.85)
.0285
```

## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2d4d70dde5"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new incoming loans accepted (sorted by PD in descending order)
- Essentially the true-positive (TP) fraction of loans from our confusion matrix (sensitivity)
- Maybe change this to different code snippet
```python
if prob_default > cutoff:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}


`@script`

## Acceptance Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "31bc94031f"
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of new incoming loans accepted (sorted by PD in descending order)
- Essentially the true-positive (TP) fraction of loans from our confusion matrix (sensitivity)

- Pandas screenshot of some example probabilities from the test set that are sorted
- Small section highlighted here

```python
if prob_default > cutoff:
  loan_status = 1 #Default
else:
  loan_status = 0 #Non-Default
```{{2}}


`@script`



---
## Bad Rate

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ae3e1fe56"
code_zoom: 85
```

`@part1`
- Percentage of the new loans allowed by acceptance rate that are actually defaults
- Essentially the false-positive (FP) fraction of loans from our confusion matrix (1 - specificity)

- Pandas screenshot of some example probabilities from the test set that are sorted
- Small section highlighted (the rest of the set from the previous slide)

```python
sum(new_default_after_cutoff)/length(new_default_after_cutoff)
```{{2}}

## Strategy Testing

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7cb8753e74"
```

`@part1`
- Used to test different combinations of acceptance rate and bad rate based on the firm's tolerances
- If I can only accept 8% of my loans to be bad, then my acceptance rate might be 65%
- Example table

## Visualizing the Strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ecf0351f27"
```

`@part1`
- Plots Acceptance Rate against Bad Rate to better establish 
- Example plot
